# Parametrik - parametrized svg drawings

## Setup 

### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### How to install for local development

`poetry install`

`poetry shell` - activates virtual environment

### How to start development server and run tests

`docker-compose up`

`docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate`

### Testing

`docker-compose up test`

### QA checks - black, flake8, xenon

`tox`

## Solution decisions

I decided to use dockerized setup for the project. It has separate development service configuration.
For the needs of testing with the dockerized database I also prepared `test` service that uses
the same image as a `web` API service. I also considered database agnostic tests but in this case, 
much of the logic is handled by the database itself.

To deal with geometric objects I decided to use PostGIS and configured it to work with Django 
(following [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/gis/)). I felt that
this is a right tool for that problem. Database stores geometric objects properly and gives
validations. With this I didn't have to write geometric logic for my own, so that the solution is
less error prone. I was also motivated by PostGIS `AsSVG` annotation that could be used for 
generating SVG images.

During the implementation I realised that the format of SVG output from PostGIS is different 
than example `output.svg` file but I stayed with that tech stack, because the final result wasn't
different.

In the code I provided separation between view and core logic. View uses provided services to 
generate projections. There is also a custom serializer that converts and validates user input to the internal
data objects represantation (entities). 

Tests are provided on two stages - integration and unit. Unit tests verifies internal core logic
without touching any external dependencies. On the integration level tests uses django test database
and verifies real projections from given coordinates to database represenataions and finally
svg contents.


## Questions to a domain expert

- I assumed that it is better to store each part of the bookcase as a separate database object.
Because it feels like better option for generating real parametric documents for the factories.
  I also considered storing whole product in a single column field (multipolygon in postgis). 
  What is better in this situation?
  
- PostGIS provides 3D support but it was quite hard to use it in this case. This is why I choosed
to store 2D projections instead of whole cubes in the database. However, is it giving any
  benefits to have 3D representations in this case? Finally our product is the 2D projection
  to a given plane ðŸ¤”
  
## Further work

1. Decision regarding storing multiple objects in a single column or staying with 1-M relation
between `Projections` and `ProjectionsPart` should be made.

1. Moving complex queries with annotation to the `QueryManager` that could provide better
segregation and simplify service layer.
   
1. Provide more elaborated serializer for the API input - it could verify each field and support both
multiple and single object serialization (now it's handling only multiple objects)
   
## My feedback

I started on Wed 19.05.2021 and was putting some bits of work everyday till today - 26.05.2021.
I spent totaly 10-11 hours for this project. It took some time to find the best tools for that
and I had to learn a bit about PostGIS. Project setup with that database also took more time than
usual but finally I played with something new :) It was a very nice and interesting task!
My wife was also excited because I finally learned how to draw ðŸ˜…
